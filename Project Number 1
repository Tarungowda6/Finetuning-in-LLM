1. Setup Development Environment
   
In this example, we use the PyTorch Deep Learning AMI with already set up CUDA drivers and
PyTorch installed. We still have to install the Hugging Face Libraries, including transformers and
datasets. Running the following cell will install all the required packages

# install Hugging Face Libraries
!pip install "peft==0.2.0"
!pip install "transformers==4.27.2" "datasets==2.9.0" "accelerate==0.17.1" "evaluate==0.4.0" "bitsandbytes==0.37.1"
loralib --upgrade â€“quiet
# install additional dependencies needed for training
!pip install rouge-score tensorboard py7zr
